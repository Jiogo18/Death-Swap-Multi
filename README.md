- stop by running /function death_swap_multi:mega/stop
	every entites added by Mega Death Swap left the game but not others entities
	doesn't stop the game (/function death_swap_multi:party/pause)
- every entities of the world (except #death_swap_multi:mega_blacklist) join the game if there is a player at less than 128 blocks


# Errors
- Timeout: a timeout can append when every players aren't swapped
	- random isn't good (an infinitely rare case)
	- when an entity (mega death swap) is in an unloaded chunk
- Disappeared: an entity can disapear when:
	- she is in an unloaded chunk
	- she died during the swap (a rare case)
